What’s Inside the Algorithm Types

-Supervised Learning: Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM, Linear Regression
-Unsupervised Learning: K-Means, PCA
-Semi-Supervised Learning: Label Propagation, Self-Training
-Reinforcement Learning: Q-Learning, DQN
-Ensembles: Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Bagging
-Deep Learning: CNNs, RNNs (with CV and time-series angles)
-NLP (Transformers): BERT/GPT-style attention, text classification & summarization
-Generative AI: GANs, Diffusion models for synthetic media & prototyping
-Graph Learning: GNNs for recommendations and relational insights
