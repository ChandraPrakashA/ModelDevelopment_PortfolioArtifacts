Learning experience:
During this course, I’ve learned how algorithms form the foundation of ML driving how models interpret data, identify patterns and make predictions. For this portfolio artifact, I developed a visual framework showing key algorithm categories, their learning styles and their real-world applications across domains like tabular data, computer vision, NLP and generative AI.
 This helped me connect technical knowledge with how algorithms operate in practice, something I often apply while building scalable systems at work.
Reflection:
Building this visual framework helped me see how different machine learning techniques connect and complement each other. It also made me realize how my own career path has progressed from working with Decision Trees and SQL-based analytics at Infosys to exploring Generative AI tools for creative problem solving. This exercise reminded me that machine learning is not just only for accuracy but also about selecting the right method that matches data, context, and purpose.
